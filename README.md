This software belongs to the paper: 
"Time-Limited Waveforms with Minimum Time Broadening for the Nonlinear Schrodinger Channel" by Y. Jaffal and A. Alvarado
The paper is available on arXiv: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2206.11240 and it is submitted to the Journal of Lightwave Technology

To obtain Fig. 2 of the paper, run the script PlotFig2.m, and so on for the remaining figures

For the optimization and using the fmincon function, check the details in the readme document in the 'DispersionOnly' folder

The folder 'LossyFiber' contains the matlab functions and results for the lossy fiber

The folder 'LosslessFiber' contains the matlab functions and results for the lossless fiber

The folder 'DispersionOnly' contains the matlab functions and results for the dispersion-only channel

The folder 'data' contains the used prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) and their eigenvalues, 
we obtained them using the software in:
R. Adelman, N. A. Gumerov, and R. Duraiswami, "Software for Computing the Spheroidal Wave Functions Using Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic," arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.0074, Aug. 2014.
